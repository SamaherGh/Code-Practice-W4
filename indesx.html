                        <p>The elements of design are best understood as being the <span>building blocks</span> of any project.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>Lines </span>in graphic design, can be used for a wide range of purposes: stressing a word or phrase, connecting content, creating patterns and more.</li>
                            <li><span>Colour</span> is used to generate emotions, define importance, create visual interest and unify branding. See our post on Colour Psychology for more detail.</li>
                            <li><span>Texture</span> relates to the surface of an object. Using texture in graphic design adds depth and visual interest. This can be applied graphically in the form of pattern or through the choice of printable surface.</li>
                            <li><span>Size</span> In graphic design, size is used to convey importance, attract attention and create contrast.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="line">

                        <h3 class="color">Principles of graphic design</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span>Balance</span> any element placed on a page carries a visual weight. It can range from form to size, color, and texture. In order to make a design feel stable or have balance, the elements need to have a certain scale.</li>
                            <li><span>Unity</span> is the harmony produced by all the elements in a design piece. For instance, using similar colors that match and integrate elements organically makes it appear as if they belong together and are not just put on a page.</li>
                            <li><span>Contrast</span> refers to the level of difference between design elements in order to create visual hierarchies. The variation makes certain elements stand out more than others. You can apply contrast by using colors, textures, sizes, and shapes.</li>
                            <li><span>Emphasis</span> is a strategy to get the viewerâ€™s attention to a specific design element. This can be in any form: a button, a website, or an image. The purpose is to create something that will stand out from the rest of the page.</li>
                            <li><span>Pattern</span> is the repetition of more than one design element. While repetition focuses on a single element being repeated, pattern refers to multiple elements repeated throughout a design</li>

                        <p>Design is not about pictures placed together and arranged in a way that creates a story. Design is about creating harmony among the elements and having them come together in a final product that is unequivocally outstanding.</p>
